    Campus Carpool is an application that makes it possible to carpool from and to a university. We purposefully limit
    our target audience to professors, student, assistants and employees of uiversities.
    </b>
    <br>
    On one hand, this increases the change to match rides (as either the start or finish will be a university), and on
    the other hand, because students are well aware that transport isn't free
    <br>
    Public transport is not always a quick way to get to campus. Carpooling can sometimes be a solution for a poor
    connection. Other times, it could be the answer to public transport strikes.
    <br>
    By having multiple people share a car, fuel costs are reduced, making carpooling financially attractive. We hope
    that our app helps you find a travel buddy to your campus.
